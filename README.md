# rsomics-world

A Cargo workspace of single-binary CLI tools that displace the C/Python/R-era
bioinformatics toolchain with **modern Rust**: fearless parallelism, explicit
SIMD, a sane installer (`cargo install rsomics-<name>`), no build-system
ceremony.

Most upstream tools are single-threaded, memory-inefficient, and written in
2005-era C or pure R. Modern multicore + SIMD + GPU resources sit idle. The
goal of `rsomics-*` is to put them to work, tool by tool, while staying
binary-compatible with upstream so existing pipelines can swap in piecewise.

## Architecture

Two layers, one workspace, one git repo. See [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md)
for the rules; the short version:

- `crates/foundation/` — **Layer A**, library-only primitives (IO, intervals,
  k-mers, FM-index, alignment cores, stats). A crate is in A iff ≥ 2 tools
  depend on it.
- `crates/tools/` — **Layer B**, each crate is one installable binary
  (`rsomics-fastp`, `rsomics-bam`, `rsomics-bwa`, …).
- Dependency direction is **B → A → external**, enforced. A never depends on
  B; B never depends on B; sharing happens through A.

Per-domain planning lives under [`docs/`](docs/):

Each module's `README.md` is the scope file; the topic files inside carry
TODO checklists using the entry schema in [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md).
[`TODO.md`](TODO.md) is the flat aggregated view across modules.

## Status

Public monorepo workspace, **Phase 2 in progress**. The first tool
(`rsomics-fastp`) lives at [`crates/tools/rsomics-fastp/`](crates/tools/rsomics-fastp/);
foundation primitives live under `crates/foundation/`. Once `rsomics-common`
and `rsomics-fastp` are published, both will install via
`cargo install rsomics-<name>`.

## Why Rust?

See [`docs/00-overview/motivation.md`](docs/00-overview/motivation.md). Short
version: memory safety, fearless parallelism (`rayon`), modern packaging
(`cargo`), explicit SIMD (`std::simd`), and a maturing scientific stack
(`ndarray`, `polars`, `arrow`, `candle`) make Rust a credible host language
for the next generation of bioinformatics tools — much of which is still
written in 2005-era C with hand-rolled allocators and brittle Autotools
builds.

## How to read this repo

- Start with [`docs/00-overview/`](docs/00-overview/) for context and
  principles.
- Browse module READMEs for scope.
- [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) is the cross-module checklist.
- [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) covers architecture, the TODO schema,
  the external-dependency quadrants, license + clean-room rules, and the
  four first-class platform targets.
